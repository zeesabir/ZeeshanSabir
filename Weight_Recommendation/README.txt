Explanation
Function convert_to_cm(height, unit):

Converts the user's height to centimeters based on the unit they provide (inches, feet, or centimeters).
Function recommend_weight(height_cm):

Same as before, this function provides a weight recommendation based on height in centimeters.
Function main():

Prompts the user to enter their age, height, and the unit of height.
Converts the height to centimeters using the convert_to_cm function.
If the height is successfully converted, the program recommends a weight range.
If the unit is invalid or if the height input is not a number, the program will notify the user.
